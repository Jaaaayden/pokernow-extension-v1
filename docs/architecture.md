# Architecture

How PokerNow Tracker works on the inside, and why it is built the way it is. For
what each feature does and how to use it, see the [README](../README.md) and the
[guide](guide.md). For the log format itself, see [findings.md](findings.md).

## The design principle

The product is a persistent, queryable database of PokerNow hands, keyed to stable
player identity, with every per-player stat derived at read time. The live HUD is
one consumer of that database, not the product.

Actions are stored raw, with their street and sequence. Nothing is pre-aggregated.
That is what makes spot queries possible at all: a pre-aggregated schema cannot
answer "hands that reached this point", while a raw one can filter to any line and
then measure behaviour inside it.

It also explains three other properties:

- **Merging two players is a single UPDATE**, and nothing is recomputed, because
  no statistic is materialized.
- **Position is computed at query time** from `seats_from_button` and
  `n_dealt_in` and is never stored. Seat 4 is UTG on one hand and the cutoff on the
  next once two players leave.
- **Table sizes are pooled by default.** Storage keeps `n_dealt_in` raw, so a
  pooled stat can always be split later (`--split-by-size`), while a fragmented one
  can never be unpooled. Other PokerNow HUDs pre-segment by table size in
  *storage*, which fragments every denominator past the point of repair, so they
  show `--` everywhere. Here `--` means only what it says: the denominator is
  empty, and the rate is unknown rather than 0%.

Every stat definition (numerator, denominator, exclusions and judgement calls) is
pinned in [`pnt/stats/SPEC.md`](../pnt/stats/SPEC.md). That file is the artifact;
`derive.py` mirrors it, and any disagreement between them is a bug.

### What is stored rather than derived

- **`equity_cache`** is the one derived table. All-in equities are computed once
  and kept there, and it is safe to drop. The first `pnt allin` or page load after
  an import takes about half a second per preflop all-in; everything after that is
  instant. Flop, turn and river all-ins are enumerated exactly. Preflop all-ins are
  sampled (50,000 seeded deals, marked `~`).
- **Review marks and notes** are the only judgements that are stored rather than
  derived on every request, because nothing in a log could ever re-derive them.
  They live on the *hand*, so a hand with two flags, or one that appears on two
  players' reviews, is marked once and noted once. They are keyed on the hand's own
  number within its game rather than on `hand_id`, which a rebuild reassigns, so
  `pnt rebuild` leaves them alone.
- **The alias table** is the one thing a re-import cannot rebuild, which is why
  it is exported to [`pnt/logs/aliases.csv`](../pnt/logs/aliases.csv) and kept in
  the repo.

### Identity merges and their undo

`POST /aliases/merge` returns the IDs it moved rather than a count, because the
merge deletes the source player row: that list is the only record of what was
behind it. `POST /aliases/split` takes it back. A merge followed by its undo
restores every number exactly, which `test_identity_api.py` asserts.

Merging cannot be automated. The names one ID has shown (`harry <- bread, Woolball
(har), wool, wool ball, fish`) are not related by any string comparison, so the
players page shows the evidence and leaves the decision to a person.

## Parser: what to know before you touch it

1. **`bets N`, `raises to N`, `calls N`, and the live forced posts `posts a
   straddle of N` and `posts a missed big blind of N`, are all cumulative for the
   street**, not incremental. Get this wrong and every pot, net-won figure and
   bb/100 is wrong while still looking plausible. A conservation law over every
   hand in every fixture guards it.

   The forced posts are the nastier half. An additive straddle over-counts the pot
   by exactly the small blind and then *hides*: the straddler's next `raises to N`
   re-derives from the street total and cancels the error. The error only survives
   in hands where the straddler never acts again, so it surfaced in 6 fold-arounds
   out of 34 straddles. It was invisible in aggregate and wrong in the ledger.

   A forced post can also be **all in**. A stack shorter than the blind it owes
   posts what it has, and the log says so on the same line: `posts a big blind of 1
   and go all in`, the same suffix `bets` and `raises to` carry. The rule must
   accept it, because an unmatched post is not a missing label but a missing
   *blind*: those chips never reach the pot and the hand records no blind post at
   all. `test_allin_posts.py` pins it.
2. **The roster is the `Player stacks:` line**, meaning the dealt-in roster. It is
   never join events and never "who acted". Getting it wrong is invisible: every
   rate comes out quietly too low for exactly the players who sit out most.
3. **Unrecognized lines are recorded, never dropped.** `pnt misses` shows them. An
   empty table is the claim that the parse was total.
4. **A log can end mid-hand.** That hand carries `complete = False`, stored on the
   row. Its chips are half-recorded, so it is excluded from the conservation law
   rather than counted as a mismatch, and from bb/100 rather than booked as a loss
   that never happened. Everything else about it is real (the folds, bets and
   showdowns all happened), so it still counts for every other stat. Re-importing
   the finished export repairs it.

Hands with a dead button or a dead blind are left out of the positional view only,
since those are the two cases where the position *label* is best-effort. They still
count in `pnt stats`, because the actions are certain even when the label is not.

## Live capture

`pnt/extension/` is an unpacked Chrome extension (Manifest V3). On a
`pokernow.com/games/…` page (or the older `pokernow.club` address) it does four
things.

1. **Polls the game's log endpoint** with the page's own session cookie:
   `GET /games/{gameId}/log?after_at=…&before_at=…`. This is the endpoint
   `PokerNowGrabber` uses, and the captcha does not gate it.
2. **Normalizes the response** into `{entry, at, order}`, the same three fields as
   the CSV export, and posts it to `POST /ingest`. Live capture and backfill feed
   one parser with identical input, so they cannot disagree. Overlapping fetches
   are free because `/ingest` dedupes on `(game_id, order)`.
3. **Shows the HUD** in Chrome's side panel, keyed by PokerNow ID via
   `GET /hud/{gameId}`. No manual seat mapping is needed: the log names every
   player as `Name @ ID`, and the alias table already joins one person's devices.
4. **Follows the hand** by calling `GET /live/{gameId}` on every poll that brings
   lines. That endpoint parses the hand in progress straight from the raw lines,
   without a rebuild, and works out each player's spot as a filter. Because the live
   view reads raw lines, the whole-game rebuild that refreshes the roster and stats
   waits for `-- ending hand --` (with a one-minute safety net) instead of running on
   every poll. The poll reads `/live` before any rebuild or HUD refresh, so the live
   view never waits behind them.

### How capture reads the log

PokerNow's `/log` endpoint was checked against a live table on 2026-09-11
([findings.md](findings.md) §8). It returns `{logs: [{at, created_at, msg}]}`,
newest first, 50 lines per request. `created_at` is exactly the CSV export's
`order`, so a line captured live and the same line imported from a CSV later land
on one row.

Its `after_at` only *filters*: it returns the newest 50 lines above the value,
never the next 50. So the extension pages backwards with `before_at` until it
reaches lines already stored ([`pager.js`](../pnt/extension/pager.js)), pausing 3 s
between pages because PokerNow answers bursts with HTTP 429. The first load of a
long game takes several minutes to walk its history. The HUD fills in as it goes,
and the ⚙ settings' **history** row says when it is complete.

Everything that knows the response shape is in
[`normalize.js`](../pnt/extension/normalize.js). If PokerNow changes it, the ⚙
settings say **UNRECOGNIZED** and the page console prints the first item.

### Reacting to the table

The poll interval is only the slowest the HUD can be. The content script also
watches the table on the page ([`watch.js`](../pnt/extension/watch.js)): the pot,
the board, the dealer button, and each seat's classes, bet and stack. When an
action changes any of them (a bet moves chips; a fold or a check moves
`decision-current` to the next seat), it polls `/log` straight away, so the HUD
follows the action within about a second. The log is still the only thing read into
the tracker; the table only says when to look. Table-triggered polls start at least
a second apart. A change that finds no new log line yet gets up to three more looks
a second apart, and the shot clock (which redraws constantly) is ignored.

The table also says who is to act before the log does. The name on the
`decision-current` seat goes to the side panel as soon as it moves, so the chart
switches to that player at once, on all their hands, and narrows to their spot when
`/live` catches up.

[`spot.js`](../pnt/extension/spot.js) holds the follow rules as plain functions:
whom the chart shows, when a spot is sent, and how to tell a spot the chart echoes
back from one the user typed.

The websocket trigger (`gC` / `gameResult`) is deliberately not used. A 5-second
poll is fast enough for a HUD and survives a PokerNow socket change.

## One API, two transports

Every JSON route is declared once, in [`pnt/api.py`](../pnt/api.py): its path, its
parameters with their limits, and a handler that returns plain data or raises
`ApiError`. Two things serve that table:

- **`pnt/server/app.py`** mounts each route on FastAPI. It adds only what an HTTP
  server on this machine needs: the static pages, the log-folder sync thread, and
  the checks on who may call it.
- **`pnt/engine.py`** answers the same routes in-process, with no web framework. It
  is for the copy of the tracker that runs inside the extension on Pyodide when no
  server is installed. Requests go in as text and answers come out as text
  (`handle_json`), so nothing but strings crosses between JavaScript and Python.

Input checks (a game ID's shape, `min >= 1`, `by` in `preflop|made`) live in
`api.py` as plain Python rather than FastAPI annotations, so both transports refuse
exactly the same requests. Nothing `api.py` or `engine.py` imports may need more
than the standard library or start a thread, because Pyodide has neither;
`test_engine.py` checks that.

### The built-in tracker

`scripts/build_extension.py` builds the extension people install (`dist/extension/`).
It adds Pyodide, from the pinned npm release checked against npm's integrity hash,
and the engine's Python as `engine/pnt.zip`. The Web Store does not allow loading
code from anywhere else, so both are copied into the package.
`pnt/extension/` on its own has neither and is the companion-only extension that
`pnt extension` prints.

- **Where it runs.** A service worker cannot start a Web Worker and is stopped
  whenever it goes quiet. So `background.js` opens an offscreen document
  (`offscreen.html`) on the first request. That document starts
  `engine.worker.js`, which runs `enginehost.mjs`: Pyodide, the engine, and the
  database. After five quiet minutes with no game tab open, it saves and closes.
- **Where the data is.** Python's sqlite3 in Pyodide can only reach Emscripten's
  in-memory file system, so the database lives there while the engine runs. It
  is saved whole to the extension's private file storage (OPFS). `createWritable`
  swaps the new file in only on close, so a save cut short leaves the last one
  whole. The engine keeps SQLite's journal in memory (`journal_mode=MEMORY`):
  with WAL, recent commits would sit in a second file the save never copies.
- **When it saves.** A merge, rename, note or review mark is saved within a
  second, because nothing could rebuild it. Captured lines wait up to 30 s. If
  the engine stops before saving them, the background sends every game tab a
  `resync` when the engine next starts. The tab forgets its cursor and walks
  PokerNow's log back to lines the engine has, so the gap fills from PokerNow.
- **Which tracker.** `backend` in the ⚙ settings is `builtin` or `companion`. A
  fresh install starts on `auto`, which settles on first use: the companion if
  one answers, else the built-in tracker. After that it never switches by
  itself, because that would split one evening's hands across two databases. An
  update from a version without the built-in tracker is set to `companion`, since
  that is where its hands are.

### The pages

The dashboard pages (stats, chart, review, all-in, pots, players) live in
`pnt/extension/pages/`. The same files are the extension's own pages and the
companion server's (`app.py` serves them from there), so there is one copy. Three
rules let one set of files work under both origins:

- **Links are relative.** `chart.html?player=…` works under
  `chrome-extension://…/pages/` and under `127.0.0.1:52000/`.
- **Every request goes through `api.js`.** `pntFetch` is a plain `fetch` on the
  server. In the extension it is a message to the background worker, which sends
  it to whichever tracker is chosen. The side panel frames the extension's
  `chart.html`, so the chart works the same with either tracker.
- **No inline script.** Manifest V3 forbids inline scripts, inline event handlers
  and `javascript:` URLs in extension pages, so each page's script is the `.js`
  file beside it.

`test_pages.py` checks all three rules.

### Measured on Pyodide

Measured 2026-09-28 on a real database of 10,434 hands in 43 games (35 MB). The
same script ran on CPython 3.11 and on Pyodide 314.0.7 (Python 3.14, SQLite 3.39,
built in) under Node 22. Times are in milliseconds:

| | CPython 3.11 | Pyodide |
|---|--:|--:|
| boot Pyodide + import the engine | – | 1,900 |
| `/live` (hand in progress) | 13 | 11 |
| `/live` after one new line | 3 | 3 |
| ingest one line | 0.3 | 0.2 |
| `/hud` warm | 77 | 94 |
| `/hud` first call after startup | 3,253 | 3,450 |
| `/hud` after a rebuild (every hand) | 235 | 290 |
| `/live` after a rebuild | 5 | 5 |
| range chart | 315 | 339 |
| tags | 465 | 353 |
| review | 3,309 | 3,481 |
| rebuild the biggest game (9,631 lines) | 166 | 213 |
| ingest that game as new, then rebuild | 196 | 316 |

WebAssembly costs little here: Pyodide's newer Python makes up most of the gap.

`/hud` after a rebuild used to cost the same as the first call, about 3 s. It
re-derived every hand in the database twice: once for the lifetime report and
once for each seated player's tags. A rebuild follows every hand. The server hid
this behind its threads, but the engine has one thread, so a `/live` sent during
that `/hud` would have waited 3 s. Now both caches are built from per-game
pieces, keyed on a stamp (`games.derived_gen`) that a rebuild sets on its own
game only:
- the lifetime report is summed from each game's counts (a `Tally`);
- each player's facts are kept per game.

After a hand, only that game is derived again. Only the first call after startup
still derives everything.

## Background server

Two things can keep the companion server running, and they can be installed side by
side: whichever starts first serves, and the other stands by.

- **Chrome itself** (`pnt connect`, all platforms). `pnt/native.py` registers a
  native messaging host, `com.pokernow.tracker`, allowed to talk to the extension
  IDs it was given. While the extension's tracker is the companion, its background
  worker keeps a port open to the host. Chrome starts `python -m pnt.native`, which
  runs the server in-process until the port closes. An open port also keeps the
  service worker alive, so the server lasts exactly as long as the browser. Stdout
  is Chrome's message channel (length-prefixed JSON), so everything else the host
  prints goes to `~/.pnt/server.log`.
- **Task Scheduler** (`pnt service`, Windows), described below: always on, whether
  Chrome is open or not.

`pnt service install` registers a Task Scheduler task for your Windows user. The
server starts hidden at every login and restarts itself after a crash, with no
terminal and no admin rights. It is built this way for these reasons:

- **`--db` is resolved to a full path at install.** The task does not start in your
  project folder, and a missing database file is created empty rather than
  reported, so a relative path would give a server that answers and shows zero
  hands. `install` refuses a path that does not exist.
- **A terminal `pnt serve` wins.** If the port is already taken, the task waits
  instead of crash-looping, and takes over once you close the terminal.
- **Two Windows defaults would kill it:** tasks are ended after 72 hours, and
  whenever a laptop goes on battery. Both are turned off.
- **The port is 52000, not 8000.** 8000 is the busiest port on a developer's
  machine, and the clash is quiet in both directions: this server holding it makes
  your other server fail to bind, and your other server holding it makes the task
  wait politely forever while the HUD reports the tracker unreachable. 52000 is in
  the IANA dynamic range, which is never assigned to a registered service. `--port
  N` changes it; set the same address in the extension's ⚙ settings.
- **Re-installing ends the running instance first.** The task is registered
  `IgnoreNew`, so a start request is *silently* ignored while an instance is alive.
  Without ending it first, changing `--db` or `--port` rewrote the definition,
  reported success, and left the old server running on the old settings.
- **Crashes restart in-process**, after 1 s and doubling up to 60 s. A run longer
  than a minute resets the delay. Task Scheduler's own restart is only a backup.
- **Idle cost** is about 75 MB of memory (a 62 MB server behind an 11 MB venv
  launcher) and no measurable CPU. The server only works when the extension posts.
  Stopping or restarting the task takes the launcher's child down with it, so
  nothing is left holding the port.
- **Only this machine and the extension get in.** The server has no login, and any
  page open in the browser can send requests to 127.0.0.1. So it grants no CORS
  (the extension's background worker reads answers through its host permission;
  PokerNow's own pages never need to). It answers only a `Host` of `127.0.0.1` or
  `localhost` (or the `--host` it was started with), which stops DNS rebinding. It
  refuses any write without an `x-pnt` header or from a foreign `Origin`: no page
  can add a custom header cross-site without a preflight the server never grants.
  A game ID must match `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}`, because it becomes a file name in the
  log folder. `test_api.py` pins all four.

### Why setup is one command

`pnt service install` refuses a database that does not exist, and it is right to:
a missing file would be created empty, and the HUD would then quietly show
nothing. But until the first import nothing had created a database, so a fresh
install ran that command, got an error, and had no obvious next move. `pnt setup`
does the steps in order.

## Redaction

`pnt redact` keeps a `Your hand is` entry only when the same two cards also appear
in a `shows a` entry for that hand, and drops the rest. A matching show *is* you
showing, since two players cannot hold the same two cards, so what survives is what
the table already saw. On the 20-log corpus that keeps 1,451 of 5,006 hands and
removes 3,555.

Matching on *cards* rather than on identity has three consequences:

- It never needs to know which player is hero, so it cannot protect the wrong one.
- It fails closed. A one-card voluntary show does not match a two-card hand, so that
  entry goes too. The shown card survives in the `shows a` entry, where it was
  public to begin with.
- The copies still import. `infer_hero` votes on hands where hero's cards match a
  showdown holding, which is exactly what is kept, so a published log still
  identifies its own hero.

Nothing else in an export carries a hidden holding. `collected N from pot with …
(combination: …)` names five cards, but only ever for a player who showed
(`test_redact.py` asserts that over every fixture log), and `Undealt cards:` is by
definition the part of the deck that reached nobody.

Only the removed lines change; every other byte is copied unchanged, so the diff
against the original is pure deletions. Originals are never written to, and `--out`
refuses to point at the folder they live in.

## Testing

```bash
pytest -q
python scripts/build_extension.py   # enginehost.test.mjs runs the built Pyodide
node --test pnt/extension/*.test.mjs
```

The Python suite is organized around invariants rather than examples:

- `test_amounts.py`: chips in equal chips out, on every hand. It also pins the two
  forced-post cases by hand: a straddle that restates the street total, and a
  missed big blind that absorbs the small blind posted with it.
- `test_parser.py`: the big-blind poster lands on the big-blind slot on every hand,
  and two independent position derivations agree on all 548 regular hands.
- `test_idempotent.py` is **the success criterion as a test**. Re-importing changes
  no stat. A partial capture plus a later full import converges on the same numbers
  as a clean import, and shuffled out-of-order ingest converges too.
- `test_stats.py`: derived stats are checked against a hand-worked manual count of
  20 hands, including the exact set of BB walks that must be excluded.
- `test_identity.py`: IDs survive churn, names do not, and merges are cheap.
- `test_caching.py`: reading less, and not deriving twice, change no number. One
  player's figures read only that player's hands. The unfiltered report is memoized
  against a counter that is bumped inside the same transaction as every change that
  could invalidate it, so a cache hit is provably current.
- `test_incomplete_hands.py`: a truncated hand leaves bb/100 alone and counts
  everywhere else.
- `test_redact.py`: a published log gives away no holding that a showdown did not,
  and redaction touches nothing else. Every surviving line is byte-identical and in
  order, every stat is unchanged, and hero is still identifiable.
- `test_sample_logs.py` guards what actually ships. Every file in `pnt/logs/` is
  re-audited, so a raw export dropped in there fails the suite rather than shipping
  in the next release. It also proves the sample fallback triggers on an *empty*
  log folder only, never on a small one and never on an explicit path.
- `test_concurrency.py`: concurrent writers queue instead of failing. Two tabs on
  one table, or `pnt import` while the server is up, put two writers on the file. A
  deferred transaction that reads before it writes cannot upgrade, and SQLite
  refuses it *without* consulting `busy_timeout`. Every write therefore goes through
  `writing()`, which takes the lock up front with `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`.
- `test_api.py` and `test_identity_api.py` run every API case twice, once against
  the HTTP server and once against the in-process engine, so the two cannot drift.

The node test files cover the extension: response normalization, backwards
paging, the table watch, and the follow rules in `spot.js`. `enginehost.test.mjs`
runs the built-in tracker on real Pyodide: it captures a game, checks when it saves
and that reads never do, and restarts from the save. It is skipped until the
extension has been built.
