"""Replace the real players in logs with stand-ins, for logs published to strangers.

`redact` takes out the hole cards a log should not give away; this takes out who
was playing. The bundled sample corpus ships to everyone who installs the tracker,
and a player's name and PokerNow ID are theirs: people who did not agree to be in
a download should not be findable in one.

A player appears in a log in one shape only, quoted as ``"name @ id"`` (in join
and quit lines, in every action, in ``Player stacks:``). Each real name becomes
``player N``, numbered in order of first appearance, and each real ID a stand-in
of the same length and alphabet. The game ID goes too: PokerNow serves any game's
log to anyone who has its ID, so a real one would lead straight back to the
original, names and all.

Every stand-in is the same everywhere in one run, across every file, so what the
tracker derives is unchanged: the same hands, the same stats, the same hero
(`infer_hero` votes on IDs, which map one to one), and merges still line up once
the alias file is run through the same `Pseudonyms`. They come from a keyed hash
whose key is random and never kept, so nobody can check a guessed real ID against
the published ones -- and running this again gives different stand-ins.
