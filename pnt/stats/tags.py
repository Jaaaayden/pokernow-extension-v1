"""Player tags: one archetype, the exploits the data supports, and the fun ones.

A tag is a claim about a player that you can act on at the table -- "never bluffs
the river", "folds to 3-bets" -- backed by a count and a spot filter that puts the
hands behind it on the chart. SPEC.md, "Tags", pins every rule: what is counted,
over what, the threshold, and the smallest sample that may fire it. This module
mirrors that section the way `derive.py` mirrors the stat tables.

Three things every rule respects:

- **Too small a sample is unknown, not false.** A rule under its minimum is silent,
  on the same principle that prints `--` for a rate with no opportunities.
- **Shown-hand evidence is biased toward showdowns.** A player's river bets that
  reached showdown are the ones that got called; the bluffs that worked are not in
  the sample. Every tip built from shown hands says "shown".
- **Nothing is stored.** Tags are computed from `Facts` at read time, like every
  other figure, so a threshold change is an edit here and in SPEC.md, not a migration.

`THRESHOLDS` holds every cutoff in one place. The values were calibrated against
the 8,036-hand database on 2026-09-14: the first draft fired for the whole table on
some rules and could never fire on others.
