"""Decision points: where a player stands in a hand, written as a filter.

Mirrors SPEC.md, "Decision points (nodes)". The walk here is `derive._preflop`
and `derive._postflop` with the *situation* pulled out at each action, so a node's
filter names exactly the facts those two functions would set on the finished hand.
That is what lets a hand still in progress be looked up in a player's history --
the node is a spot, and a spot is a filter.

Pure: `HandRow` in, nodes out; `resolve` takes the player's `Facts` rather than a
database. Nothing here is stored.

    earlier node on the path that has a filter. Only completed hands count: the

    the texture is there to sharpen what they showed up with, and a split over
    two hands sharpens nothing.

    `showings` is read on the street of the *live* node, whichever node answers.
    `decision` is what this player did at the spot that answers -- the live
    node's own decision, or None while it is pending -- and `arrived` says the
    answer comes from an earlier node on the path: a player facing a 5-bet with
    no history of it is shown their 4-bet spot, the range they arrived with, and
